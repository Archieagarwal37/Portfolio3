                    <br>
                </h1>
                <h2>A UI/UX Design Case Study</h2>
                <br>
                <h1 style="font-size: xxxx-large;">Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                    In the digital healthcare space, users often find themselves lost in poorly structured interfaces,
                    unclear service flows, or disconnected tools. This project involved the redesign of an existing
                    healthcare website that offered essential services like ambulance booking, health checkups, and
                    online consultations ‚Äî but lacked clarity, accessibility, and user trust.



                    <br>

                    As the lead UX/UI designer, I took on the challenge of rethinking the entire platform with a goal to
                    streamline the user experience, create visual harmony, and most importantly ‚Äî ensure users could
                    access life-critical services with confidence and ease. The redesign aimed to improve usability,
                    responsiveness, and user trust, particularly during moments of stress or urgency.
                    <br>
                    <b>Note: Due to confidentiality agreements, the original platform name and designs cannot be
                        disclosed publicly.
                    </b>

                </p>
                <br>

                <h1 style="font-size: xxxx-large;">Problem Statement</h1>

                <p>
                    The existing platform had multiple usability and accessibility challenges:<br>

                    Overwhelming navigation: Services were not clearly grouped, leading to user confusion and
                    drop-offs.<br>

                    Lack of urgency flow: Emergency services like ambulance booking lacked priority visibility or
                    intuitive access.
                    <br>
                    Generic interface: The old design lacked warmth, clarity, and trust-building elements for a
                    healthcare audience.
                    <br>
                    Non-responsive layout: The website did not adapt well across devices, limiting accessibility for
                    mobile users.
                    <br>
                    Low visual hierarchy: Important CTAs and content areas were not distinguishable, delaying
                    decision-making.
                    <br>
                    These factors negatively impacted user retention, satisfaction, and task completion rates.

                <h1 style="font-size: xxxx-large;">Project Overview</h1>
                <p>
                    This redesign project focused on transforming the platform into a more user-centric, visually clean,
                    and purpose-driven interface, enabling users to:
                    <br>
                    Book ambulances quickly based on live location
                    <br>
                    Schedule health checkups with local verified providers
                    <br>
                    Consult doctors online with easy appointment setup
                    <br>
                    Access health reports and view service history
                    <br>
                    Receive alerts and reminders for booked services or prescriptions
                    <br>
                    The scope included a complete website redesign, with mobile responsiveness and visual accessibility
                    as top priorities.

                <h1 style="font-size: xxxx-large;">Design Approach</h1>
                <p>
                    Bring clarity and trust to the user experience<br>

                    Create clear service segmentation with minimal cognitive load<br>

                    Redesign the IA (Information Architecture) for easier discovery
                    <br>
                    Ensure mobile responsiveness and accessibility compliance (WCAG)
                    <br>
                    Add empathy to the interface ‚Äî soft, clean, and comforting visual design

                <br>
                <h1 style="font-size: xxxx-large;">Design Process</h1>
                <p>
                    1. UX Audit & User Interviews <br>
                    Conducted a full audit of the existing platform (heuristics, flow gaps, loading issues).<br>

                    Interviewed 15 users who had previously used the website for urgent or regular bookings.<br>

                    Key Insights:<br>

                    70% struggled to find ambulance or emergency options quickly.

                    60% said the visuals and layout didn‚Äôt make them feel secure or cared for.

                    50% were unaware of features available due to poor navigation or grouping.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2. Revised User Flow & IA<br>
                    Restructured the core flow to ensure faster access and reduced clicks:
                    Home ‚Üí Choose Service ‚Üí Fill Minimal Info ‚Üí Confirm ‚Üí Follow-up Page.<br>

                    Grouped services under Emergency, Consultation, and Routine Care for mental clarity.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3. Wireframing & Prototyping<br>
                    Created multiple iterations of mid- and high-fidelity wireframes for:<br>

                    Homepage with quick access tiles<br>

                    Ambulance Booking Page with live location & ETA<br>

                    Doctor Consultation Module with time slots and filters<br>

                    Health Record Dashboard with upload & download options
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    4. UI Design & Visual Language
                    <br>
                    Typography: Clean sans-serif for high readability<br>

                    Colors: Light backgrounds with calming blues and greens; red used only for emergency CTA<br>

                    Components: Rounded corners, card layouts, and accessible contrast for all elements<br>

                    Icons: Simple, universally recognizable healthcare symbols
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    5. Responsive & Accessible Design
                    <br>
                    Used mobile-first principles and ensured fluid layouts. Added alt-text and keyboard navigability for
                    assistive tech users.
                </p>
                <br>





                <h1 style="font-size: xxxx-large;">Solution Highlights</h1>

                <p>
                    Quick-Tile Homepage: Users can immediately select a service (Ambulance, Consultation, Checkup).<br>

                    Emergency-first Interface: Emergency button with location detect is persistent on all screens.<br>

                    Streamlined Booking Forms: Smart forms with autofill and location detection.<br>

                    Consultation Flow: Doctors displayed with time slots, ratings, and specialties for better
                    decision-making.<br>

                </p>
                <br>
                <h1 style="font-size: xxxx-large;">Impact & Reflections</h1>
                <p>Post-redesign evaluation (internal and limited user testing) showed:<br>

                    Time to task completion (ambulance booking) reduced by 52%.<br>

                    User trust levels increased by 48%, based on satisfaction surveys. <br>

                    Bounce rate on homepage reduced by 35%.<br>

                    Mobile usage increased by 60%, attributed to responsive layouts.


                </p>

                <br>

                <h1 style="font-size: xxxx-large;">Reflections & Learnings</h1>
                <p>
                    This redesign project deepened my understanding of designing under pressure and for empathy.
                    Healthcare UX isn‚Äôt just about flow ‚Äî it‚Äôs about trust, timing, and clarity. I focused on building
                    an interface that felt calm, easy, and reliable ‚Äî especially for users who might be experiencing
                    high stress.

                    <br>
                    Even though the project remains confidential and designs cannot be publicly shared, the work taught
                    me to prioritize both emotional and functional design in sensitive domains like healthcare. The next
                    phase includes integrating more accessibility tools and building a minimal mobile app for instant
                    emergency¬†access.
