                </h1>
                <h2>A UI/UX Design Case Study</h2>
                <br>
                <h1 style="font-size: xxxx-large;">Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                    A home reflects more than just walls and furniture ‚Äî it embodies personality, comfort, and
                    inspiration. But finding decor that aligns with one's taste, budget, and spatial needs can often
                    feel daunting. Decora is a digital shopping platform built to transform that experience ‚Äî helping
                    users discover and shop the perfect decor that brings life to every space.




                    <br>
                    As a UX/UI designer, I envisioned and crafted Decora to be an inviting, intuitive, and personalized
                    essential experience. Whether it‚Äôs a cozy reading nook or a full room makeover, Decora empowers users
                    to make thoughtful style choices with ease, backed by smart filters and a delightful user journey.

                <h1 style="font-size: xxxx-large;">Problem Statement</h1>

                <p>
                    Users looking for home decor online often face:<br>

                    Overwhelming product options with minimal guidance or personalization.<br>

                    Lack of visual context, making it hard to picture how items fit together.<br>

                    Tedious comparison process across platforms and styles.<br>

                    Impersonal experiences, with generic recommendations and confusing layouts.<br>

                    These challenges contribute to user drop-offs, cart abandonment, and low design satisfaction.

                <p>
                    1. Research & User Persona Building<br>
                    Conducted online surveys and 1-on-1 interviews with 25+ decor shoppers.<br>

                    Findings:<br>

                    72% said they abandon carts due to lack of visual clarity or uncertainty in style fit.<br>

                    65% want to shop by room type or mood, not just categories.<br>

                    50% were influenced by curated collections or seasonal picks.<br>

                <h1 style="font-size: xxxx-large;">Reflections & Learnings</h1>
                <p>
                    Designing Decora was about more than just making shopping easy ‚Äî it was about creating an experience
                    that feels like home. I focused on balancing visual comfort with practical UX, guiding users through
                    a world of possibilities without overwhelming them. The emotional tone of the platform ‚Äî warm,
                    welcoming, personal ‚Äî shaped every design decision.
                    <br>
                    The next phase includes launching the mobile version and integrating AR-based ‚ÄúView in Room‚Äù features to elevate visualization¬†even¬†further.
